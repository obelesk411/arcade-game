# HTML5 Canvas Game With Bugs && Stuff
This is a portfolio piece meant to demonstrate my javascript skillz and experience with the canvas element.

## Installation
git clone 
cd arcade/dist/
open index.html in browser

## Configuration
You can configure the score board and change the sprites used by changing the values in the the top of app.js.
```
var scoreBoardColor = 'white';
var scoreBoardFont = '48px serif';
var playerSprite = 'images/char-boy.png';
var enemySprite = 'images/enemy-bug.png';
```

## Usage
Use the arrow keys to move your player

Press P to pause and unpause

You get 4 lives

If you come into contact with a bug you'll lose a life and the player will move back to the starting postion.

If you make it across to the river you'll score a point and your player will move back to the starting position.

Remember your training and you might make it back alive.
